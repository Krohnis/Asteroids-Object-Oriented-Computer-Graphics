Assignment #3

-(U) is still used as reload
-(.) is used for pausing the game
-The only change to the program is for muting, as the current mute in submission number 1 calls method soundPause() for both
of the cases, pausing and unpausing, instead of soundPause() and soundPlay(). That is the only major change.
-Change fixed an issue where muting sound once, muted sound forever, only applied to original's mute, not to its pause, that worked
fine
-Sorry to ask, but could you Please go by the November 24th date. Sorry again.
